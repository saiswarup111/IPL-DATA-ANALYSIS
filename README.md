IPL_Data_Analysis
Utilized SQL to analyze IPL matches data set, focusing on playerâ€™s performances.

-- 1. We will create database schema to load the tables

CREATE DATABASE ipl;

-- 2. Create table to store data

CREATE TABLE ipl.matches( id integer, season integer, city varchar(20), date date, team1 varchar(20), team2 varchar(20), toss_winner varchar(20), toss_decision varchar(20), result varchar(50), dl_applied integer, winner varchar(50), win_by_runs integer, win_by_wickets integer, player_of_the_match varchar(50), venue varchar(20), umpire1 varchar(20), umpire2 varchar(20), umpire3 integer);

CREATE TABLE ipl.deliveries (matchid integer, inning integer, batting_team varchar(20), bowling_team varchar(20), overc integer, ball integer, batsman varchar(20), non_striker varchar(20), bowler varchar(20), is_super_over integer, wide_runs integer, bye_runs integer, legbye_runs integer, noball_runs integer, penalty_runs integer, batsman_runs integer, extra_runs integer, total_runs integer, player_dismissed varchar(20), dismissal_kind varchar(50), fielder varchar(20));

-- 3. Check the tables structure

-- 4. Now, Load the data in tables

SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE 'local_infile';

-- SET GLOBAL local_infile = 'ON';
SET GLOBAL local_infile=1;

Now, Begin with the queries:
